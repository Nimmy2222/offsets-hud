# offsets-hud
bhop plugin to display sync offsets on the hud

this is a heavily slimmed down version of the plugin on wallah/rk, I don't feel like maintaining the full version. if its broken msg me

this plugin works from OnPlayerRunCmdPost, this is important because when used in conjunction with plugins that change your angles/keypresses(an autostrafer), this HUD should give you an accurate representation of how that plugin is affecting your sync.
